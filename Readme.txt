Portfolio Website - Nouman's Portfolio
Created by: Hafiz Noman
Date: [28th April 2023]

Overview:
My portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects to potential clients and employers. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and is hosted on github.

Design and Development:
I started by creating wireframes and mockups to plan out the structure and layout of the website. Then, I built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used a CMS (content management system) to manage the content on the website.

Features:
The portfolio website includes the following features:

Home page: Provides an introduction to myself and my work.
About me: Describes my background, education, and experience.
Projects: Displays my portfolio of projects.
Services: Display the services I provided.
Contact: Provides a contact form for potential clients and employers to get in touch with me.
Challenges:
During the development process, I encountered some challenges with browser compatibility and responsive design. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by testing the website on multiple devices and making adjustments to the code as needed.

Lessons Learned:
Building my portfolio website helped me develop my technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained experience in design principles and user experience (UX) design.

Future Improvements:
In the future, I plan to improve the performance of the website by optimizing images and code. I also plan to add more projects to the portfolio and enhance the UX design.
